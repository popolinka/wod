# wod, a project dedicated to Workout of the Day (WOD), as in Crossfit.
A guide/project starting from crawling to WoD websites, scraping WoDs, editing the data a bit...
1. cs34 is for the WODs from Crossift34 (crossfit34.com), puts them into cs34.txt file 
and 
2. crossfit.com does the same for crossfit.com obviously.
3. TODO: CSBalaban allegedly does the same thing for CrossfitBalaban (crossfitbalabanlevent.blogspot.com) but needs furhter improvements, thus the omission in MergeNSelect.

MergeNSelect basically merges the two .txt file, and spits out random workouts from the merged file.

TODO: ... _and (hopefully) eventually will end at some deep learning/ml/neural networks to create new/unique workouts from the data at hand_
